## Development Log Entries

### 2026-01-19 - Initial Planning
**Time:** Planning phase
**Objective:** Set up documentation structure for Jetson project

**Activities:**
- Created documentation folder structure
- Defined project scope and integration plan
- Reviewed Jetson specifications against project requirements

**Observations:**
- Jetson Orin Nano capabilities well-suited for Meshtastic coordination
- 40 TOPS AI performance may enable future intelligent routing features
- Multiple USB 3.2 ports perfect for connecting multiple radio devices
- Power requirements (19V/4.74A) higher than typical embedded boards - need appropriate supply

**Challenges:**
- Need to determine optimal connection method (USB vs GPIO UART)
- Enclosure design needs to account for cooling requirements
- Power solution for field deployment not yet determined

**Solutions:**
- Will start with USB serial connection (simplest, most supported)
- Plan to test thermal performance before finalising enclosure design
- Defer power solution until deployment requirements are clearer

**Next Steps:**
1. Unbox and inventory Jetson kit components
2. Prepare microSD card with latest JetPack image
3. Complete initial hardware setup
4. Begin systematic testing checklist

**Documentation:**
- Created comprehensive documentation set in `_Jetson/` folder
- Files created: README, getting-started, hardware-specs, testing-checklist, project-integration, development-log
