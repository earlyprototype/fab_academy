# Phase 3: Execution Roadmap

**Purpose:** Complete all assignments and final project based on Global Evaluator requirements.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't start this phase until Phase 1 Task 1 is complete (evaluator feedback received). The priorities and approach will depend on their specific requirements.

---

## Execution Strategy

### Priority System:
- **P0 - BLOCKING GRADUATION:** Must be done, non-negotiable
- **P1 - HIGH IMPACT:** Significant work, but necessary
- **P2 - POLISH:** Improvements to existing work
- **P3 - NICE TO HAVE:** Only if time permits

### Time Blocking Approach:
- **Deep Work Blocks:** 2-4 hour focused sessions for complex tasks (CAD, design, documentation)
- **Quick Wins:** 30-60 minute sessions for polishing/small tasks
- **Making Time:** Hands-on fabrication, assembly, testing
- **Admin Time:** Documentation updates, photo taking, GitLab updates

---

## Track A: Assignments

*NOTE: Specific assignments will be detailed in `assignments-tracker.md` after the audit in Phase 1*

### Assignment Completion Workflow Template:

For each assignment that needs work:

1. **Review & Plan (15-30 min)**
   - [ ] Re-read assignment requirements
   - [ ] Check evaluation criteria
   - [ ] List what's missing or needs improvement
   - [ ] Estimate time needed

2. **Execute (varies)**
   - [ ] Do the work
   - [ ] Take photos/videos throughout
   - [ ] Take notes for documentation

3. **Document (1-2 hours)**
   - [ ] Write up process on GitLab page
   - [ ] Add images with captions
   - [ ] Explain design decisions
   - [ ] Include files (CAD, code, etc.)
   - [ ] Reflect on learning

4. **Review & Publish (30 min)**
   - [ ] Check against evaluation criteria
   - [ ] Ensure all files are linked
   - [ ] Push to GitLab
   - [ ] Mark as complete in tracker

### Special Case: The Assignment That Needs Redoing
**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKING

- [ ] Get specific feedback from evaluator on what wasn't original enough
- [ ] Brainstorm 3-5 alternative approaches
- [ ] Choose approach that:
  - Demonstrates originality
  - Can be completed with available time/resources
  - Shows understanding of the concepts
- [ ] Create new design from scratch
- [ ] Fabricate and test
- [ ] Document thoroughly with emphasis on design process and originality
- [ ] Submit for review

**Time Estimate:** [TBD after evaluator feedback]

## Track B: Final Project

*Detailed breakdown in `final-project-breakdown.md`*

### Current Understanding (from your context):
- Meshtastic-based system (swarm communication)
- Needs proper system architecture
- Needs enclosures (possibly concrete)
- Not fully tested as a swarm
- Now incorporating NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano

### Final Project Workflow:

#### 1. Architecture & Planning (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Define system architecture clearly:
  - How many nodes?
  - What does each node do?
  - How does Jetson integrate?
  - Communication protocols
  - Power architecture
  
- [ ] Create system diagram
- [ ] List all components needed
- [ ] Identify what's already done vs what needs building

#### 2. Meshtastic Swarm Testing (6-8 hours)
- [ ] Set up test environment
- [ ] Configure multiple nodes
- [ ] Test basic mesh communication
- [ ] Test range and reliability
- [ ] Test edge cases (node dropout, recovery, etc.)
- [ ] Document results
- [ ] Identify any issues and solutions

#### 3. Jetson Integration (8-12 hours)
- [ ] Define Jetson's role in the system
- [ ] Develop communication interface with Meshtastic
- [ ] Test integration
- [ ] Develop any necessary software/firmware
- [ ] Document integration process

#### 4. Enclosure Design & Fabrication (12-16 hours)
- [ ] Design enclosures for each node type
- [ ] Consider: weatherproofing, mounting, access, aesthetics
- [ ] Create CAD models
- [ ] Decide on fabrication method (3D print test, then concrete? Or just 3D print?)
- [ ] Fabricate moulds if using concrete
- [ ] Produce enclosures
- [ ] Test fit and assembly
- [ ] Iterate if needed

#### 5. System Integration & Testing (8-12 hours)
- [ ] Assemble all nodes in their enclosures
- [ ] Integrate Jetson
- [ ] Full system test
- [ ] Demonstrate key functionality
- [ ] Capture video of system working
- [ ] Document any issues and how you solved them

#### 6. Final Project Documentation (12-16 hours)
- [ ] Project overview and concept
- [ ] System architecture documentation
- [ ] Design process (with Design Thinking methodology woven in)
- [ ] Fabrication process for each component
- [ ] Assembly instructions
- [ ] Testing and validation
- [ ] Bill of materials
- [ ] Source files (CAD, code, schematics)
- [ ] Future improvements
- [ ] Final presentation video
- [ ] Update project page on GitLab

## Track C: Design Thinking Integration

**Goal:** Weave Design Thinking methodology into final project documentation

### Design Thinking Framework:
1. **Empathise** - Who is this for? What problem does it solve?
2. **Define** - Clear problem statement
3. **Ideate** - Exploration of solutions
4. **Prototype** - Building and testing
5. **Test** - Validation and iteration

### Implementation in Your Project:
- [ ] Write "Empathise" section:
  - Who would use a Meshtastic swarm?
  - What needs does it address?
  - Research and user context

- [ ] Write "Define" section:
  - Clear problem statement
  - Project goals and constraints
  - Success criteria

- [ ] Document "Ideate" phase:
  - Show alternative approaches you considered
  - Why you chose this architecture
  - Sketches and early concepts

- [ ] Document "Prototype" phase:
  - This is most of your build process
  - Show iterations and improvements
  - What worked, what didn't

- [ ] Document "Test" phase:
  - Testing results
  - User feedback (if applicable)
  - Final refinements

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours (mostly writing, based on work you've already done)

## Execution Timeline Template

*To be filled in after Phase 1 completion*

### Week 1-2: Quick Wins & Blocking Issues
- [ ] Assignment that needs redoing (if feedback received)
- [ ] 2-3 assignments that are nearly complete
- [ ] Start final project architecture documentation

### Week 3-4: Final Project Core Work
- [ ] Meshtastic swarm testing
- [ ] Jetson integration
- [ ] Enclosure design

### Week 5-6: Final Project Fabrication & Assembly
- [ ] Enclosure fabrication
- [ ] System integration
- [ ] Testing and refinement

### Week 7-8: Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Complete all final project documentation
- [ ] Polish remaining assignments
- [ ] Final review of all work
- [ ] Submission preparation

## Risk Management

### Potential Blockers:
1. **Evaluator doesn't respond quickly**
   - Mitigation: Send follow-up, work on known issues in parallel

2. **Equipment/materials not available**
   - Mitigation: Identify alternatives, order parts early, have backup plans

3. **Technical issues with Meshtastic or Jetson**
   - Mitigation: Join community forums, allocate extra time for debugging

4. **Casting tests fail**
   - Mitigation: Have 3D printing as backup enclosure method

5. **Overwhelming workload causes freeze**
   - Mitigation: Break into smallest possible chunks, celebrate small wins, ask for help

### Contingency Plans:
- [ ] Identify which parts of final project could be simplified if time is short
- [ ] Have backup enclosure approach (3D printing) ready
- [ ] Know which assignments are absolutely critical vs nice-to-have

---

## Success Criteria for Phase 3:
- [ ] All P0 assignments complete
- [ ] Final project fully functional and documented
- [ ] All documentation published on GitLab
- [ ] Design Thinking methodology clearly demonstrated
- [ ] Ready for final evaluation
- [ ] YOU GRADUATE!
