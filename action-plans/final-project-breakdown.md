## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Meshtastic range insufficient | Medium | High | Test early, adjust node placement/power |
| Jetson integration problems | Medium | Medium | Join forums, allocate debug time |
| Concrete casting fails | Medium | Low | Have 3D print backup plan |
| Component failures | Low | High | Order spare parts |
| Time overrun | High | High | Start with minimum viable system, add features if time permits |

### Project Risks:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Scope too ambitious | High | High | Define MVP early, descope if needed |
| Lab equipment unavailable | Medium | Medium | Book equipment early, have backup access |
| Materials delayed | Low | Medium | Order early, have alternatives ready |
| Burnout/overwhelm | Medium | High | Break into chunks, celebrate wins, ask for help |

## Minimum Viable Project (MVP)

*If time is tight, what's the minimum that demonstrates competency?*

**Core Features (Must Have):**
1. [ ] Functional mesh network (at least 3 nodes)
2. [ ] Jetson integration showing value-add
3. [ ] At least one node in finished enclosure
4. [ ] Clear documentation of process
5. [ ] Demonstration video

**Nice to Have (If Time Permits):**
1. [ ] All nodes in custom enclosures
2. [ ] Concrete enclosures as planned
3. [ ] Advanced AI/ML features on Jetson
4. [ ] Polished finish and aesthetics
5. [ ] Extended range testing

**Descoping Plan:**
- First to go: Concrete enclosures (use 3D printed)
- Second to go: Advanced Jetson features (keep basic functionality)
- Third to go: Multiple node enclosures (one demo enclosure, others functional but basic)
