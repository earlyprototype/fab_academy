# Phase 2: Skills Development (Parallel Track)

**Purpose:** Build the skills needed to execute your assignments and final project efficiently. These can run in parallel with foundation work and execution work.

**Approach:** Short, focused practice sessions. Don't aim for mastery - aim for "good enough to get the job done."

---

## Track 1: CAD Upskilling
**Priority:** HIGH - APPLIES ACROSS PROGRAMME
**Total Time Estimate:** 10-15 hours spread over 2-3 weeks

### Current Skill Level Assessment:
- [ ] Document what CAD software you're using (Fusion 360? FreeCAD? Other?)
- [ ] What can you currently do?
- [ ] What specific skills do you need for your projects?

### Learning Path:
- [ ] **Basics (if needed) - 2-3 hours**
  - Sketch fundamentals
  - Extrude, revolve, loft
  - Basic assembly
  
- [ ] **Project-Specific Skills - 5-8 hours**
  - [ ] Enclosure design (for your Meshtastic nodes)
    - Mounting holes and standoffs
    - Access panels
    - Cable management
    - Weatherproofing considerations
  
  - [ ] Mould design (for concrete casting)
    - Draft angles
    - Parting lines
    - Registration features
    - Two-part moulds
  
  - [ ] Design for manufacturing
    - 3D printing constraints
    - CNC milling considerations
    - Laser cutting design (if applicable)

- [ ] **Practice Projects - 3-4 hours**
  - [ ] Design simple enclosure for Jetson or existing component
  - [ ] Design simple 2-part mould for concrete test
  - [ ] Fabricate and test fit
  - [ ] Iterate based on results

### Resources:
- [ ] Identify 2-3 specific tutorials for your CAD software
- [ ] Join relevant Discord/forum for quick help
- [ ] Find example projects similar to yours

### Success Criteria:
- Can design functional enclosures with proper tolerances
- Can design mouldable forms for casting
- Confident enough to iterate quickly when things don't fit

## Track 2: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Testing
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH - NEW ASSET, NEEDS EVALUATION
**Total Time Estimate:** 8-12 hours initial testing

### Phase A: Setup and Familiarisation (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Unbox and inventory what you have
- [ ] Flash latest JetPack OS
- [ ] Complete initial setup
- [ ] Connect to network
- [ ] Install essential tools
- [ ] Document the setup process (for your documentation)

### Phase B: Capability Testing (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Run basic GPU tests
- [ ] Test AI/ML capabilities (run sample models)
- [ ] Check power consumption
- [ ] Test thermal performance under load
- [ ] Document specs and performance

### Phase C: Project Integration Planning (2-4 hours)
- [ ] How does this fit into your final project?
- [ ] What can it do that other components can't?
- [ ] What are its limitations?
- [ ] Design integration architecture:
  - [ ] How does it connect to Meshtastic nodes?
  - [ ] What processing happens on Jetson vs nodes?
  - [ ] Power requirements and solutions
  - [ ] Physical mounting/enclosure considerations

### Success Criteria:
- Jetson is set up and tested
- Clear understanding of how it fits in your final project
- Documentation ready for your GitLab page

## Track 3: Casting Research and Practice
**Priority:** MEDIUM - NEEDED FOR FINAL PROJECT ENCLOSURES
**Total Time Estimate:** 6-10 hours (including drying time)

### Research Phase (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Research concrete mix ratios for small castings
- [ ] Understand release agents and mould materials
- [ ] Learn about reinforcement options
- [ ] Research surface finish techniques
- [ ] Find examples of electronics enclosures in concrete

### Materials Acquisition (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Create shopping list:
  - Concrete/cement mix
  - Mould material (silicone? 3D printed?)
  - Release agent
  - Mixing tools
  - Safety equipment
- [ ] Purchase materials
- [ ] Identify workspace for casting (messy work!)

### Practice Runs (3-5 hours + drying time)
- [ ] **Test 1: Simple form**
  - Cast a basic shape to understand the process
  - Learn about air bubbles, mix consistency
  - Test demoulding
  
- [ ] **Test 2: More complex shape**
  - Try a form with undercuts or details
  - Test different mould materials if needed
  
- [ ] **Test 3: Functional prototype**
  - Cast a small enclosure-like form
  - Test durability, mounting options
  - Assess if this is the right approach for your project

### Decision Point:
- [ ] Is concrete the right material, or should you pivot?
- [ ] What worked well?
- [ ] What needs refinement?
- [ ] Update final project plan accordingly

### Success Criteria:
- Successfully cast at least one functional prototype
- Understand the process well enough to plan final enclosures
- Documented the process for your project pages

## Skills Development - Overall Progress Tracking

### Week-by-Week Targets:
**Week 1:**
- [ ] CAD basics refresher
- [ ] Jetson unboxing and setup
- [ ] Casting research

**Week 2:**
- [ ] CAD practice project 1
- [ ] Jetson capability testing
- [ ] First casting test

**Week 3:**
- [ ] CAD practice project 2
- [ ] Jetson integration planning
- [ ] Second/third casting tests

### Flexibility Notes:
- These tracks can be picked up when you have energy/focus
- Some can happen in parallel with Phase 3 execution
- Don't let perfectionism block you - aim for "good enough"
- If you hit flow state on one topic, ride that wave

### Success Criteria for Phase 2 Overall:
- CAD skills sufficient for project needs
- Jetson tested and integrated into project plan
- Casting process understood and documented
- Confidence in your ability to execute the final project
