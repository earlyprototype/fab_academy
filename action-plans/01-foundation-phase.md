# Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

**Purpose:** Establish clear requirements, understand current status, and identify all blockers before diving into execution.

**Critical Success Factor:** This phase unlocks everything else. Don't skip ahead until you have clarity from the Global Evaluator.

---

## Task 1: Reconnect with Global Evaluator
**Priority:** URGENT - BLOCKING ALL OTHER WORK
**Time Estimate:** 2-3 days (including wait time for response)

### Sub-tasks:
- [ ] Draft email to Global Evaluator
  - Explain your situation honestly
  - Request specific feedback on what's needed to complete
  - Ask about the assignment that needs redoing (design originality issue)
  - Confirm deadline expectations for Jan 2026 completion
  - Ask if there's any flexibility or support available

- [ ] Prepare questions list before sending:
  - [ ] Which assignments specifically need work?
  - [ ] What level of completion is required for each?
  - [ ] Final project: what are the minimum viable deliverables?
  - [ ] Is there a hard deadline, or can this be negotiated?
  - [ ] What's the assessment process timeline?

- [ ] Send email

- [ ] While waiting for response, proceed with Task 2 (Work Audit)

**Success Criteria:** Clear written confirmation of what's required to graduate

---

## Task 2: Complete Work Audit
**Priority:** HIGH - NEEDED FOR PLANNING
**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours

### Sub-tasks:
- [ ] Review all weekly assignments on your GitLab page
- [ ] For each assignment, document in `assignments-tracker.md`:
  - Current completion status (%)
  - What's missing or needs improvement
  - Time estimate to complete
  - Dependencies (skills/equipment/materials needed)

- [ ] Review final project documentation
- [ ] List what's complete vs incomplete in `final-project-breakdown.md`

- [ ] Identify the assignment that needs redoing
  - [ ] Understand exactly what wasn't "original enough"
  - [ ] Brainstorm alternative approaches
  - [ ] Estimate redesign + fabrication time

**Success Criteria:** Complete picture of where you actually are vs where you need to be

---

## Task 3: Map Dependencies and Blockers
**Priority:** HIGH - NEEDED FOR SCHEDULING
**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

### Sub-tasks:
- [ ] Create dependency map:
  - What skills are needed for which tasks?
  - What equipment/materials do you need to acquire?
  - What tasks block other tasks?
  - What can be done in parallel?

- [ ] Identify "quick wins" (tasks that are 80% done, just need polish)

- [ ] Identify "deep work" tasks (need focused time, e.g., CAD design)

- [ ] Flag tasks requiring external resources:
  - [ ] Lab equipment booking
  - [ ] Component purchases
  - [ ] Materials for casting tests
  - [ ] Support from others (if needed/available)

**Success Criteria:** Clear visual map showing the critical path to completion

---

## Task 4: Update Action Plans Based on Evaluator Feedback
**Priority:** HIGH - DEPENDS ON TASK 1
**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

### Sub-tasks:
- [ ] Once Global Evaluator responds, revise all plans accordingly
- [ ] Adjust priorities based on actual requirements
- [ ] Update time estimates
- [ ] Create realistic timeline with milestones
- [ ] Identify if anything can be descoped or simplified

**Success Criteria:** Concrete, achievable roadmap aligned with evaluator requirements

---

## Phase 1 Completion Checklist
- [ ] Global Evaluator has responded with clear requirements
- [ ] All assignments audited and documented
- [ ] All final project components audited and documented
- [ ] Dependency map created
- [ ] Action plans updated based on feedback
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Phase 2 and Phase 3

**When this phase is complete, you'll have:** Confidence that you know exactly what needs doing and how to approach it.
