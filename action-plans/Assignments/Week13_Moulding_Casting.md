## What's Actually Documented (from week13-content.html)

### ✅ Complete Process Documentation

#### 1. Introduction (lines 179-183)
- Context: Creating cast ear for final project
- Application: Binaural audio recording experiments
- Material selection: Urethane (silicone unavailable)
- Safety focus: SDS review emphasized from group work

#### 2. Step 1: Designing the Mould (lines 191-196)
- **Software:** Blender
- **Source:** Scanned ear STL from Week 5
- **Process:**
  - Cuboid created to encompass ear
  - Boolean modifier (Difference) for negative impression
  - Hollowing with Solidify modifier (2mm wall thickness)
  - Second Boolean operation
- **Image:** Boolean operation screenshot included

#### 3. Step 2: Printing the Mould (lines 198-205)
- **Hardware:** Formlabs 3B+ SLA Printer
- **Software:** PreForm (Formlabs slicer)
- **Settings:**
  - Material: Clear V4 Resin
  - Layer height: 0.050 mm
  - Orientation: Open-side-up (minimize internal supports)
  - Automatic support generation (standard settings)
- **Images:** PreForm screenshot, printer photo included

#### 4. Step 3: Finishing and Repairing (lines 207-222)
- **Post-processing:**
  - Form Wash: 20 minutes in IPA (standard Clear V4 cycle)
  - Form Cure: 20 minutes at 60°C
  - PPE: Gloves, safety glasses
- **Repair process:**
  - Thin wall (2mm) broke during printing/handling
  - Plasticine used to fill gap
  - **Plastikote clear spray sealant** (2 coats) to seal plasticine
  - **Polycryl No. 59 Wax Release** applied to entire interior
- **Images:** Wash station, cure station, printed mould, repair detail, sealant application
- **Safety:** SDS links provided for Clear V4 Resin, IPA, Plastikote

#### 5. Step 4: Preparing Urethane (lines 224-231)
- **Material:** Polytek Polyflex 30 PU Casting Rubber (Shore A30)
- **Volume calculation:**
  - Water displacement method
  - ~23ml measured on scale
  - Specific gravity estimated: 1.05-1.1 g/cm³
  - Total needed: ~25g
- **Mixing:**
  - 1A:1B ratio by WEIGHT
  - 3 minutes mixing (wooden stirrer)
  - Gentle but thorough (minimize air incorporation)
- **Images:** Volume measurement, materials (Part A, Part B, wax release)
- **Safety:** SDS link for Polytek Polyflex Series

#### 6. Step 5: Pouring Urethane (lines 233-236)
- **Technique:**
  - Slow pour in thin stream
  - From slight height
  - Aimed at lowest point
  - Allow material to flow up (displace air)
  - Tilt mould for detailed areas

#### 7. Step 6: Demoulding (lines 239-245)
- **Cure time:** ~6 hours (Polyflex 30 datasheet)
- **Process:**
  - Flexible SLA mould edges pulled away
  - Tweezers used cautiously on edge
  - Small part tore (undercut or insufficient release)
- **Post-processing:** Washed with water and dried
- **Images:** Demoulded ear (before cleaning), final cast (after cleaning)

### ✅ Challenges Section (lines 250-259)

**Documented issues:**
1. Thin mould walls (2mm) proved fragile → Recommend 3-4mm
2. Silicone unavailable → Forced switch to Urethane
3. Urethane bubbles → Vacuum degassing recommended
4. Part tearing during demoulding → Need better draft angles/release
5. Internal support removal from SLA mould difficult

## Possible Evaluator Concerns (if marked incomplete)

### 1. Mould Surface Finish
**Requirement:** "Ensured mold has smooth surface finish, that does not show the production process"

**Your Documentation:**
- SLA print post-processed (washed, cured)
- Repair area sealed with Plastikote
- However: Visible layer lines typical of SLA process

**If this is the issue:**
- Add section on surface finishing:
  - Sanding with progressive grits (400, 800, 1200, 2000)
  - Optional: XTC-3D coating for glass-smooth finish
  - Polishing process
- Estimate: 2-3 hours to document finishing process

### 2. Test Cast Comparisons
**Group requirement:** "Made and compared test casts with each material"

**Your Documentation:**
- Single Urethane cast documented
- Silicone mentioned as unavailable
- May need comparison of different materials

**If this is the issue:**
- Document material selection decision tree
- Compare Urethane vs Silicone properties (even if couldn't test)
- Material properties table
- Estimate: 1-2 hours

### Step 2: If Surface Finish Issue (2-3 hours if needed)
- [ ] Create "Mould Surface Finishing" section
- [ ] Document sanding progression
- [ ] Photograph surface at each stage
- [ ] Explain finish requirements for casting

### Step 3: If Material Comparison Issue (1-2 hours if needed)
- [ ] Create material comparison table
- [ ] Document selection criteria
- [ ] Explain Urethane vs Silicone differences
- [ ] Justify material choice

### Step 4: Verification (5 minutes)
- [ ] Show any updates to Oscar
- [ ] Request re-evaluation to 100%
