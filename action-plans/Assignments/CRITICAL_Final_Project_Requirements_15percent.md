2. Slide (can't graduate without it)
3. Final project page (consolidates everything)

**THEN DO THESE** (complete the picture):
4. BOM
5. System integration docs
6. Design files organization

**FINALLY** (polish):
7. Links to weeks
8. License
9. Acknowledgments
10. Verification & testing

Your final project is complete when:
- ✅ 1-minute video explaining your project exists and is accessible
- ✅ Project slide (1920x1080) exists and includes all required info
- ✅ Comprehensive final project page documenting entire project
- ✅ Complete BOM with costs and sources
- ✅ All design files available for download
- ✅ System integration clearly documented
- ✅ Links to relevant weekly assignments
- ✅ License clearly stated
- ✅ Others' work acknowledged
