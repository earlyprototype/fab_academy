## Overview
I am attempting to complete my [Fab Academy journey](https://fabacademy.org/2025/labs/creativespark/students/thom-conaty/index.html) after failing to complete it in 2025 and leaving the work until now (Jan 2026). I felt overwhelmed and couldnt face it again. I also felt unsupported by my local lead (who also happens to be my work colleague (Operations and Education Manager) in the FabLab I work at as teh Growth Manager - Creative Spark Enterprise FabLab - Dundalk).

The biggest hurdle is my [final project](https://fabacademy.org/2025/labs/creativespark/students/thom-conaty/project-concept.html) that I never completed. Remaining hurdles in this are enclosures and the architecture of the actual system. Meshtastic not fully tested in a swarm. There are also a number of assignments that need polished including one that needs redone as the final output was not original in design enough (thanks for waiting for me to finish to tell me that dude!)

General challenges that must be overcome are the need to up my 3D CAD skills - a general skill that applies across the programme. Also, the lack of effective electronics prototyping equipment in the lab which has been somewhat mitigated by the purchase of an X-Tool laser cutter which can produce PCBs rapidly. Lack of prototyping components I will just swallow the purchase. There is also the lack of a reflow oven but I will just have to accept that soldering is required. Note: Neil Gershenfeld the MIT professor running Fab Lab has a lot of strong opinions about electronics that don't ring true to me, as someone who has prototyped and brought an electronics product to market (patchblocks for Eurorack) and taught DIY electronics to 1000's of people (maker.ie) - this has led my coworkers to be dismissive of my feedback (to the point of being demotivating and mocking) and dogmatic in following Neil to his word (no leaded solder and no through hole components - also not recognising the value in a reflow oven). I also need to get to grips with casting if I want to make concrete pour enclosures for my final projects. 

Another boost to my project is the recent arrival of a NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit which I have sole use of for my final project.

## Key Goals
[ ] - Reconnect with Global Evaluator
[ ] - Upskill on CAD
[ ] - Test NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Dev Kit
[ ] - Consolidate plan for final project
[ ] - Complete outstanding project
[ ] - Weave Design Thinking methodology into Final Project Process

## Action Plan Overview
Detailed plans are in the `/action-plans/` folder. High-level phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) - PRIORITY
[ ] Reconnect with Global Evaluator and get clear requirements
[ ] Complete work audit (see assignments-tracker.md)
[ ] Map all dependencies and blockers

### Phase 2: Skills Development (Parallel track)
[ ] CAD upskilling programme
[ ] NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano testing and setup
[ ] Casting research and practice runs

### Phase 3: Execution (Post-evaluator clarity)
[ ] Polish/redo assignments as required
[ ] Final project architecture refinement
[ ] Meshtastic swarm testing and validation
[ ] Enclosure design and fabrication

**Detailed Plans:** See [action-plans folder](./action-plans/) for breakdown
